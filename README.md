# VideoflixFrontend

A Frontend project based on Netflix that works together with the videoflix-backend.

## Project

### 1. Inspiration and planing

#### Task definition

The first step was to get an overview of the functions and tasks of my front end.

#### Design inspiration

For the design, I analyzed Netflix and was also inspired by fellow students and their projects.

#### Design draft (Figma)

To get a better overview of the design, I took the time to express my ideas in Figma.
The advantage here was that I immediately recognized repeatable code and saved it as general elements.

Design decisions I couldn't think of right away I read on the page first. The goal was to integrate Figma as a flexible tool if I wanted to make design optimizations or changes without working on the whole code.

### 2. Start to Code

#### The co-operation

To make the basic structure better and clearer, I took inspiration from other projects and used ChatGPT to share my thoughts. This gave me new insights into how to structure a project.

#### The beginning

My plan for programming was to leave logic and functions out of the equation for the time being. The individual parts were divided into reusable components and stand-alone components.
This created the foundation of the front end.

## Angular

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Further help
